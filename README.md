I didn't want to write anything, but the more I thought about it later, the more it could be made into a movie. Is this also a suspense movie or a thriller? Are the ﬁlmmakers agreeing that the current audience is zero IQ, or are they deliberately holding Lily Collins' aura to deceive the
audience?

Lily is still so beautiful and young, but let Lily play a young famous prosecutor with money and background? Do n’t spray me, Lily fans, neither her image, temperament, or acting skills are competent for this role! Watching Lily's youthful and beautiful face really made me play. The screenwriter is also pitted, even writing a prosecutor so naively!

Will it be normal for a person who has spent thirty years in the dark without seeing the sun? Can he believe what he said? Can he really hate your family in order to spend the years in his later
years? It ’s ridiculous and naive, the mistress is still a famous prosecutor! The truth is as her brother said, her prosecutor's position was bought back, otherwise people with a slight IQ will doubt that they will not let go of someone who poses a huge threat to themselves and their
families! What's more, this is all his one-sided words. How about ﬁnding the corpse, can it prove that he killed or the hostess ’s father killed? What's wrong with a mistress and an illegitimate child, her whole family knows that her father is not a decent gentleman, is it surprising that a mistress has taken it? I also suspect that there is more than one mistress! When the hostess conﬁrmed the news, she was so shocked, so collapsed? 123movies,putlockers,gomovies,cinebloom,vidsrc

And the hostess, her father, can such a person be a successful banker? Not only was he prone to abuse, his personality split, he was also stupid. Since I later discovered that I was doing something wrong, but I couldn't let the secret leak out, no one could say, why should I let my daughter know? He has been conﬁned to death without food, and the secret will be buried under the ground forever! Could it be said that her father had known for a long time that the hostess was not her own, so she was always partial? 911movie.org The legacy is not only one million (his younger brother took 20 million), but also prepared a play to make Morgan's father and daughter recognize each other? However, this is illogical. When he recorded this last message, he did not know that he would be killed by Morgan. If you want to abuse the mistress and Morgan after
death, you will not drag your wife and son into the water, but the son is in the election! What a vague and divisive role, the screenwriter and the director can be really contradictory.

The only thing that can be seen in the whole ﬁlm is the intricate editing at the beginning, which makes the play enter a tense atmosphere from the beginning. But the back is getting weaker and weaker. The following arrangement allows the audience to guess the plot at once. No suspense at all, no horror! In addition, Lily's makeup is still very beautiful, or be a mistress, don't you curl up your hair and become a prosecutor.

I sincerely hope that the production company will not take any more naive and innocent scenes to deceive the audience! It is now a time of space roaming and the wandering of the earth, and the inspectors all have their heads on the items. Stop playing, screenwriter!

I also don't understand why let my daughter do aftercare. But if you think about it, it seems to explain:

Because I love my son more, I do n’t want to let this matter leave a stain on my son, or even want to let this matter interfere with my son ’s state. The ﬁnal result was that the two women at home looked at the endgame, and the mother said to her daughter, "We are the Monroe family." It is ridiculous that the mother who said this, she originally had her own surname, but according to tradition after marriage changed to the husband's surname.

The men in the movie are colluding with each other, helping each other to hide secrets, and the women are being violated, treated as private property, and asked to deal with the endgame.

It is very obscure and realistic. Old Monroe is not completely cold-blooded. He will revenge because of his wife's humiliation. He will also be proud of his daughter's career. Little Monroe also knows how to care for his sister. The men in the movie seem okay from this. It is just a lot of key
events. The female independent fantasy is still broken by the patriarchy:
